Hardware Guide
===

Jasper is designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi (Model B) and requires some additional hardware like a wifi adapter and USB microphone. The suggested hardware is indicated below with links for further details. You may try slightly different brands/specifications of hardware, but we cannot guarantee Jasper will work on them. Jasper is not affiliated with any of the linked hardware vendors.

<h2 class="linked" id='assembly'><a href="#assembly" title="Permalink to this headline">Assembly</a></h2>

Assembly of the required components is straightforward. Insert the microphone, SD card, wireless adapter, micro-USB cable, ethernet cable, and speakers into the Raspberry Pi. The USB wall charging adapter is recommended to power Jasper as a standalone device.

The ethernet cable will be used to log in to the pi from a computer during the software installation step.
